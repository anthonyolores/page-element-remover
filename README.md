# Page Element Remover
Remove element visually from the page using it's selector. In this example I am scraping Trademe website to remove their unnecessary(for me) elements which contains Ads or Promoted stuff.

# Tampermonkey
To execute this code there are 2 options. First, using chrome console or snippets(without jquery) but you need to manually run the javascript via chrome dev tools.
The second option will make the javascript(or userscript) run automatically when the page loads using Tampermonkey extension. Basically the script is wrapped by Tampermonkey extension and triggered when the page loads so the extension must be installed first.
